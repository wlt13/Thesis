abstract = {Two different size nanosilica (NS) particles, nominally 20 nm and 80 nm in diameter, and carboxyl terminated butadiene acrylonitrile (CTBN) were blended into a lightly crosslinked, DGEBA/piperidine epoxy system to investigate the toughening mechanisms in hybrid epoxy-silica-rubber nanocomposites (HESRNs). Adding small amount of NS particles into CTBN toughened epoxies further improved the fracture toughness to a level that could not be achieved by increasing CTBN content alone. Interestingly, this toughening effect is diminished when NS particles clustered at high CTBN contents. In addition, the effect of NS particle size on toughening behavior was not considerable, except the case when NS clustering is observed. According to the SEM and TOM investigations, the plastic zone, which consists of shear banding and matrix dilation, is further enlarged in front of the crack tip in HESRNs. Irwin's model is used to evaluate the process zone concept and the result indicates that zone shielding is credited for the toughening mechanism in these HESRNs. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {1 We use a grid- and simulation-based approach to extend point pattern analysis to deal with plants of finite size and irregular shape, and compare the results of our approach with that of the conventional point approximation. The plants are approximated by using an underlying grid and may occupy several adjacent grid cells depending on their size and shape. Null models correspond to that of point pattern analysis but need to be modified to account for the finite size and irregular shape of plants. 2 We use a mapped area of a grass-shrub steppe in semi-arid Patagonia, Argentina, to show that the shrub community is essentially randomly structured, but that shrubs facilitate grasses in their immediate neighbourhood. 3 The occurrence of this random spatial structure provides important new information on the biology of shrub populations. In general, previous data from semi-arid and arid ecosystems have shown that adult shrubs tend to show over-dispersed patterns, whereas juveniles are clumped. 4 We find that the point approximation may produce misleading results (i) if plant size varies greatly, (ii) if the scale of interest is of the same order of magnitude as the size of the plants, and (iii) if the plants of a given pattern are constrained through competition for space by the presence of other plants. The point approximation worked well in all other cases, but usually depicted weaker significant effects than when the size and shape of plants were taken into account. 5 Our approach to quantifying small-scale spatial patterns in plant communities has broad applications, including the study of facilitation and competition. Ecologists will be able to use the software available to take advantage of these methods.},

abstract = {The mechanics of adhesive failure have been investigated by using model adhesive joints between a cross-linked amorphous rubber and rigid polymeric substrates. The adhesive failure energy,$\theta$ , was determined over a wide range of temperatures and rates of crack propagation. For any given rubber-substrate joint the results yield a single master curve when reduced to a reference temperature by means of the Williams-Landel-Ferry equation. It is shown that $\theta$ is the sum of two components: the energy dissipated viscoelastically within the rubber at the crack tip and the 'intrinsic' adhesive failure energy $\theta$ 0. The value of the former is proportional to $\theta$ 0, so that $\theta$ can also be represented as the product of $\theta$ 0 and a function of rate and temperature. The parameter $\theta$ 0 is governed by the surface properties and compositions of the materials forming the joint. When pure interfacial failure occurs, $\theta$ 0 has a value in close agreement with the thermodynamic 'work of adhesion' determined independently.},

abstract = {To enable the effective and reliable use of structural adhesive bonding in automotive applications, the cohesive properties of a joint need to be determined over a wide range of loading rates. In this paper, a strategy for determining these properties has been described and used to analyze a set of experimental results presented in a companion paper. In the particular system studied, a crack growing in a toughened quasi-static mode could make a catastrophic transition to a brittle mode of fracture. The cohesive parameters for both the toughened and brittle modes of crack growth were determined by comparing numerical predictions from cohesive-zone simulations to the results of experimental tests performed using double-cantilever beam specimens and tensile tests. The cohesive parameters were found to be essentially rate-independent for the toughened mode, but the toughness dropped by a factor of four upon a transition to the brittle mode. The results of wedge tests were used as an independent verification of the cohesive parameters, and to verify that the quasi-static properties remained rate-independent to very high crack velocities corresponding to conditions of low-velocity impact. The effects of friction, and the use of the wedge test to determine cohesive parameters, were also explored. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A cohesive zone model for fatigue crack initiation and growth in quasibrittle materials is proposed in the present paper. While bulk material is modeled to be linearly elastic, the softening material in the cohesive zone and cracks are modeled to be internal singular surfaces in the elastic body. The interactions of the singular surfaces are described in a cohesive force law and a Coulomb-type friction law if in contact. The cohesive zone material is modeled to accumulate damage not only along the damage locus but also along an unloading path underneath it, enabling a simulation of fatigue damage and crack growth without the ad hoc imposition of a law of growth rate within the cohesive zone model. The maximum principal stress criterion is used to advance a tip of the cohesive zone in the direction of the maximum principal stress when it reaches the critical value of material strength. The physical crack tip is grown as a natural process of debonding of the cohesive zone under cyclic loading, which, in contrast, may be subcritical with energy dissipation less than the material toughness under static loading. The boundary value problem formulated for fatigue crack growth incorporating the cohesive zone model is nonlinear due to the history dependence of the cohesive zone, and is solved efficiently using the iterative single-domain dual-boundary-element method of successive over-relaxation. It is demonstrated through examples that the present model is capable of predicting fatigue crack initiation as well as growth in a unified way. It is also shown that the cohesive zone model is more advantageous and flexible in handling fatigue cracks under arbitrary loading than the classical singularity-based fracture mechanics approach.},

abstract = {In the preceding Part I of this investigation a relation was derived among the measured failure energy, $\theta$ , the energy dissipated viscoelastically during joint separation, and an intrinsic failure energy $\theta$ 0 for various rubber-to-polymer substrate joints. For some joints $\theta$ 0 was equal to the thermodynamic work of adhesion WA out for others $\theta$ 0 ≫ WA. By the use of a variety of microscopical and spectroscopical techniques it is shown in the present paper that when $\theta$ 0 ≈ WA, joint failure is wholly interfacial, but that $\theta$ 0 ≫ WA when substantial cohesive failure occurs during joint separation. It is shown that the intrinsic failure energy (which controls the total failure energy under given conditions) may be expressed as $\theta$ 0=iI+rT0+8F, where i,rand s are the area fractions of interfacial failure, rubber cohesive failure and substrate cohesive failure respectively and I,T0 and F are the corresponding failure energies (per area). For purely interfacial failure, i = 1 and I=WA. For strong joints, however, about 70 to 80{\%} of the value of $\theta$ 0 is provided by the term rT0. The departures from interfacial failure, which occur only with etch-treated substrate films, can be attributed to covalent bonding across the interface during cure of the elastomer. The reactive groups in the substrate surface are C=C double bonds produced by the etching treatment.},

abstract = {Thermoplastic toughening of epoxy resins has been actively studied since the early 1980s with considerable progress in property improvement and understanding having been made since then. The main advantage in using thermoplastics to toughen epoxy resins is that their incorporation need not result in significant decreases in desirable properties such as modulus and yield strengths as is generally the case when rubbers are used as toughening agents. However, the predominant criteria for achieving optimum toughness enhancement in the thermoplastic toughening of epoxy resins are still not all that clear front Me literature. This review has focused upon the importance of the thermoplastic endgroups, the material's morphology, the ductility of the matrix and the chemical structure of the thermoplastic, it summarizes what the authors believe are the important requirements for good thermoplastic toughening.

@article{Song2005,
abstract = {Effects of different dispersion states of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on rheological, mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties of the epoxy nanocomposites were studied. The dispersion states were altered depending upon whether a solvent was employed or not. To characterize dispersion of the CNTs, field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used. It was found that the nanocomposites containing poorly dispersed CNTs exhibited higher storage modulus, loss modulus, and complex viscosity than ones with well dispersed CNTs. It means that the poorly dispersed CNTs/epoxy composites have, from a rheological point of view, a more solid-like behavior. Tensile strength and elongation at break of the nanocomposites with different dispersion of CNTs were measured. Both of the well and the poorly dispersed CNTs composites showed a percolation threshold of electrical conductivity at less than 0.5 wt.{\%} CNTs loading and the former had higher electrical and thermal conductivities than the latter. Effects of the CNTs content on the physical properties were also examined experimentally. As loading of the CNTs increased, improved results were obtained. From the morphological observation by FESEM and TEM, it was found that when the solvent was not used in the CNTs dispersion process, aggregates of pristine CNTs remained in the nanocomposites.

abstract = {The importance of the cohesive-zone approach to analyse localisation and failure in engineering materials is emphasised and various ways to incorporate the cohesive-zone methodology in computational methods are discussed. Numerical representations of cohesive-zone models suffer from a certain mesh bias. For discrete representations this is caused by the initial mesh design, while for smeared representations it is rooted in the ill-posedness of the rate boundary value problem that arises upon the introduction of decohesion. A proper representation of the discrete character of cohesive-zone formulations which avoids any mesh bias can be obtained elegantly when exploiting the partition-of-unity property of finite element shape functions. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated by some examples.},

@article{Johnsen2005,
abstract = {Thermoplastic/epoxy blends were formed using an amine-cured epoxy polymer and a semi-crystalline thermoplastic: syndiotactic polystyrene (sPS). Complete phase-separation of the initially soluble sPS from the epoxy occurred via 'reaction-induced phase-separation' (RIPS) or via 'crystallisation-induced phase-separation' (CIPS), depending upon the thermal processing history employed. Dynamic mechanical thermal analysis showed that no sPS was retained dissolved in the epoxy polymer. For RIPS, at concentrations of sPS of up to 8 wt{\%}, the sPS is present solely as spherical particles. However, macro phase-separation, giving a co-continuous microstructure, accompanied by local phase-inversion, dominates the RIPS blends containing more than 8 wt{\%} sPS. In the CIPS blends, the sPS is present as spherulitic particles, and this microstructure does not change over the range of sPS concentrations employed, i.e. from 1 to 12 wt{\%} sPS. The pure epoxy polymer was very brittle with a value of fracture energy, G(Ic) of about 175 J/m(2). However, the addition of the sPS significantly increases the value of G(Ic), though the toughness of the RIPS and CIPS blends differs markedly. For the RIPS blends, there is a steady increase in the toughness with increasing content of sPS and an apparent maximum value of G(Ic), of about 810 J/m(2) is obtained for 8-10 wt{\%} sPS. On the other hand, the measured toughness of the CIPS blends increases relatively slowly with the concentration of sPS, and a maximum plateau value of only about 350 J/m(2) was measured in the range of 8-12 wt{\%} sPS. The relationships between the microstructure of the RIPS and CIPS sPS/epoxy blends and the measured fracture energies are discussed. Further, from scanning electron microscopy studies of the fracture surfaces and optical microscopy of the damage zone around the crack tip, the nature of the micromechanisms responsible for the increases in toughness of the blends are identified. For the RIPS blends, (i) debonding of the sPS particles, followed by (ii) plastic void growth of the epoxy matrix are the major toughening micromechanisms. The increase in toughness due to such micromechanisms is successfully predicted theoretically using an analytical model. In the case of the CIPS blends, the increase in the value of G(Ic) results from (i) crack deflection and (ii) microcracking and crack bifurcation. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A fracture mechanics approach has been used to investigate the effects of the addition of physical modifiers on the fracture energy, Gc, of brittle cyanate-ester polymers. Tests were performed using adhesive joint specimens at −55, 21 and 150°C, with all the specimens exhibiting cohesive failure in the cyanate-ester adhesive layer. The fracture energies of systems modified using a range of inorganic and thermoplastic particles, fibres and woven-mats have been measured, and scanning electron microscopy has been used to determine the toughening micromechanisms involved. Firstly, it is shown that the addition of 10{\%} by weight of particulate modifiers can increase the fracture energy of the cyanate-ester polymer by 100{\%}, due to a combination of toughening micromechanisms such as crack deflection, pinning and matrix cavitation around the second-phase particles. These experimental data have been compared to predictions from an analytical model. Secondly, it is demonstrated that the use of long fibres or woven-mats can give an a major increase in the value of the fracture energy, Gc, at initiation, and a further increase with increasing crack length, i.e. a significant ‘R-curve' effect is observed. At relatively long crack lengths, the measured fracture energy may be six times greater than that of the unmodified polymer value, due to fibres debonding and bridging across the fracture surfaces. Finally, it is shown that several of the physically-modified polymers developed in the present work have fracture energies that are greater than a typical commercially-available cyanate-ester film adhesive.},

abstract = {For crack growth by a ductile failure mechanism, the fracture process zone is represented in terms of special interface elements in the crack plane ahead of the crack. A porous ductile material model is used in the interface elements to represent the growth of voids to coalescence. In relation to the finite element mesh, the initial width of the interface is taken to be zero, but the traction separation relations represented by the interface are based on assuming an interface width of the order of the void spacing. The tangential stresses inside the interface are determined by the requirement of compatibility with the surrounding material in the tangential direction. Some comparison with predictions based on related crack growth models is used to discuss the performance of the special cohesive zone model presented here.},

abstract = {The impact wedge-peel (IWP) test is an International Standard (ISO 11343) method that is employed to measure the resistance to cleavage fracture of structural adhesives at a relatively high test-rate of 2 to 3 m/s. In the present work this test has been employed to evaluate the performance of a range of structural adhesives when used to bond either steel or aluminium-alloy substrates. Firstly, a novel test arrangement for performing these tests, using a high-speed servohydraulic machine, is described. Tests were performed at 10(-4) and 2 m/s and at test temperatures of -40 and 23 degrees C. High-speed photography was also used to investigate the failure of the IWP test specimens. Both stable and unstable types of crack growth were recorded, with the crack propagating cohesively through the adhesive layer in all cases. The methods of data analysis recommended by the International Standard are critically reviewed, and some shortcomings are highlighted. Secondly, the results from the IWP test are then directly correlated to the measured values of the adhesive fracture energies, G(c), of the adhesives, which were determined using a fracture-mechanics approach. Finally, it is demonstrated that, from knowledge of the value of G(c) of the adhesive, coupled with a finite-element analysis of the IWP test geometry, the failure behaviour of the IWP specimen may be successfully modelled and predicted.

In particular the effect of strain rate, volume fraction and particle size upon the stability of propagation, the Young's modulus, the critical stress intensity factor,KIc and the fracture energy,GIc has been studied. It has been shown that the crack propagation behaviour can be explained principally in terms of crack pinning, although it has been found that propagation is also affected by blunting the breakdown of the particle---matrix interface. It has been demonstrated that crack-front pinning is consistent with a critical crack opening displacement criterion.},

abstract = {A mode III crack with a cohesive zone in a power-law hardening material is studied under small scale yielding conditions. The cohesive law follows a softening path with the peak traction at the start of separation process. The stress and strain fields in the plastic zone, and the cohesive traction and separation displacement in the cohesive zone are obtained. The results show that for a modest hardening material (with a hardening exponent N = 0.3), the stress distribution in a large portion of the plastic zone is significantly altered with the introduction of the cohesive zone if the peak cohesive traction is less than two times yield stress, which implies the disparity in terms of the fracture prediction between the classical approach of elastic–plastic fracture mechanics and the cohesive zone approach. The stress distributions with and without the cohesive zone converge when the peak cohesive traction becomes infinitely large. A qualitative study on the equivalency between the cohesive zone approach and the classical linear elastic fracture mechanics indicates that smaller cracks require a higher peak cohesive traction than that for longer cracks if similar fracture initiations are to be predicted by the two approaches.},

abstract = {An epoxy resin, cured with an anhydride, has been modified by the addition of silica nanoparticles. The particles were introduced via a sol–gel technique which gave a very well-dispersed phase of nanosilica particles which were about 20 nm in diameter. Atomic force and electron microscopies showed that the nanoparticles were well-dispersed throughout the epoxy matrix. The glass transition temperature was unchanged by the addition of the nanoparticles, but both the modulus and toughness were increased. The measured modulus was compared to theoretical models, and good agreement was found. The fracture energy increased from 100 J/m2 for the unmodified epoxy polymer to 460 J/m2 for the epoxy polymer with 13 vol{\%} of nanosilica. The fracture surfaces were inspected using scanning electron and atomic force microscopies, and the results were compared to various toughening mechanisms proposed in the literature. The toughening mechanisms of crack pinning, crack deflection and immobilised polymer were discounted. The microscopy showed evidence of debonding of the nanoparticles and subsequent plastic void growth. A theoretical model of plastic void growth was used to confirm that this mechanism was indeed most likely to be responsible for the increased toughness that was observed due to the presence of the nanoparticles.},

abstract = {Point pattern analyses such as the estimation of Ripley's K-function or the pair-correlation function g are commonly used in ecology to characterise ecological patterns in space. However, a major disadvantage of these methods is their missing ability to deal with spatial heterogeneity. A heterogeneous intensity of points causes a systematic bias in estimates of the K- and g-functions, a phenomenon termed "virtual aggregation" in the recent literature. To address this problem, we derive a new index, called K2-index, as an extension of existing point pattern characteristics. The K2-index has a heuristic interpretation as an approximation to the first derivative of the g-function. We estimate the K-, g- and K2-functions for six different types of simulated point patterns and show that the K2-index may provide important information on point patterns that the other methods fail to detect. The results indicate that particularly the small-scale distributions of points are better represented by the K2-index. This might be important for testing hypotheses on ecological processes, because most of these processes, such as direct neighbour interactions, occur very locally. When applied to empirical patterns of molehill distribution, the results of the K2-analysis show regularity up to distances between 0.1 and 0.4 m in most of the study areas, and aggregation of molehills up to distances between 0.2 and 1.1 m. The type and scale of these deviations from randomness agree with a priori expectations on the hill-building behaviour of moles. In contrast, the estimated g-functions merely indicate aggregation at the full range from 0 to 7 m (or even above). Considering the advantages and disadvantages of the different methods, we suggest that the K2-index should be used as a complement to existing approaches, particularly for point patterns generated by processes that act on more than one scale.},

abstract = {Tapered-double cantilever-beam joints were manufactured from aluminium-alloy substrates bonded together using a single-part, rubber-toughened, epoxy adhesive. The mode I fracture behaviour of the joints was investigated as a function of loading rate by conducting a series of tests at crosshead speeds ranging from 3.33 x 10(-6) m/s to 13.5 m/s. Unstable (i.e. stick-slip crack) growth behaviour was observed at test rates between 0.1 m/s and 6 m/s, whilst stable crack growth occurred at both lower and higher rates of loading. The adhesive fracture energy, G(lc), was estimated analytically, and the experiments were simulated numerically employing an implicit finite-volume method together with a cohesive-zone model. Good agreement was achieved between the numerical predictions, analytical results and the experimental observations over the entire range of loading rates investigated. The numerical simulations were able very readily to predict the stable crack growth which was observed, at both the slowest and highest rates of loading. However, the unstable crack propagation that was observed could only be predicted accurately when a particular rate-dependent cohesive-zone model was used. This crack-velocity dependency of G(lc), was also supported by the predictions of an adiabatic thermal-heating model. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Equations for two-dimensional quadrilateral finite elements with linear and quadratic shape functions are given. Formulas for applying the technique in conjunction with three-dimensional solid elements as well as plate/shell elements are also provided. Necessary modifications for the use of the method with geometrically nonlinear finite element analysis and corrections required for elements at the crack tip with different lengths and widths are discussed. The problems associated with cracks or delaminations propagating between different materials are mentioned briefly, as well as a strategy to minimize these problems. Due to an increased interest in using a fracture mechanics–based approach to assess the damage tolerance of composite structures in the design phase and during certification, the engineering problems selected as examples and given as references focus on the application of the technique to components made of composite materials.},

We tested five methods (nearest neighbour distribution, radial distribution, Voronoi paving, quadrat count, minimal spanning tree graph) which generated nine parameters on four simulated models (random point process, hardcore model and two cluster models) and on experimental cellular models. The method which offers the best discrimination power and stability seems to be the minimal spanning tree graph edge length distribution. (C) 1997 Academic Press Limited.},

@article{Hadavinia2006,
abstract = {The adhesive fracture energy, G., is determined from two types of elastic-plastic peel tests (i.e. the single-arm 90 degrees and T-peel methods) and a linear-elastic fracture-mechanics (LEFM) test method (i.e. the tapered double-cantilever beam, TDCB method). A rubber-toughened epoxy adhesive, with both aluminium-alloy and steel substrates, has been used in the present work to manufacture the bonded joints. The peel tests are then modelled using numerical methods. The overall approach to modelling the elastic-plastic peel tests is to employ a finite-element analysis (FEA) approach and to model the crack advance through the adhesive layer via a node-release technique, based upon attaining a critical plastic strain in the element immediately ahead of the crack tip. It is shown that this 'critical plastic strain fracture model (CPSFM)' results in predicted values of the steady-state peel loads which are in excellent agreement with the experimentally-measured values. Also, the resulting values of G(c), as determined using the FEA CPSFM approach, have been found to be in excellent agreement with values from previously-reported analytical and direct-measurement methods. Further, it has been found that the calculated values of G(c) are independent of whether a standard LEFM test or an elastic-plastic peel test method is employed. Therefore, it has been demonstrated that the value of the adhesive fracture energy, G(c), is independent of the geometric parameters studied and the value of G(c) is indeed a characteristic of the joint, in this case for cohesive fracture through the adhesive layer. Finally, it is noted that the FEA CPSFM approach promises considerable potential for the analysis of peel tests which involve very extensive plastic deformation of the peeling arm and for analysing, and predicting, the performance of more complex adhesively-bonded geometries which involve extensive plastic deformation of the substrates.

abstract = {This paper reviews the cohesive process zone model, a general model which can deal with the nonlinear zone ahead of the crack tip––due to plasticity or microcracking––present in many materials. Furthermore, the cohesive zone model is able to adequately predict the behaviour of uncracked structures, including those with blunt notches, and not only the response of bodies with cracks––a usual drawback of most fracture models. The cohesive zone model, originally applied to concrete and cementitious composites, can be used with success for other materials. More powerful computer programs and better knowledge of material properties may widen its potential field of application. In this paper, the cohesive zone model is shown to provide good predictions for concrete and for different notched samples of a glassy polymer (PMMA) and some steels. The paper is structured in two main sections: First, the cohesive model is reviewed and emphasis is on determination of the softening function, an essential ingredient of the cohesive model, by inverse analysis procedures. The second section is devoted to some examples of the predictive capability of the cohesive zone model when applied to different materials; concrete, PMMA and steel.},

@article{Blackman2012,
abstract = {The present paper discusses the results of an investigation into the effects of test rate and the mode of loading on the fracture energy, G(c), of adhesively-bonded fibre-composite joints. Various carbon-fibre reinforced-polymer (CFRP) matrix composite substrates have been bonded using two different types of automotive structural epoxy-adhesives. They have been tested via loading the bonded joints in mode I (tensile), mode II (in-plane shear) and mixed-mode I/II from slow rates (i.e., of about 10(-5) m/s) up to relatively high rates of test of about 15 m/s. The high-rate tests were photographed using a high-speed digital video camera to record the deformation of the joint and the fracture behaviour. An analysis strategy has been developed for the various modes of loading (i) to account for the observed fracture behaviour, (ii) to circumvent the problems posed by oscillations in the load traces due to the presence of dynamic effects in the faster tests, and (iii) to account for the kinetic energy associated with the moving specimen arms in the faster tests. Based on the analysis strategy developed, the effect of the test rate on the fracture energy, G(c) for the different loading modes for the joints has been ascertained. Furthermore, various different fracture paths were observed in the tests. They were either cohesive, in the adhesive layer, or interlaminar in the composite substrates. The exact fracture path observed was a function of (i) the type of composite substrate, (ii) the type of adhesive, and (iii) the mode of loading employed. However, the nature of the fracture path was found to be quite insensitive to the test rate. Essentially, it was found that joints subjected to mixed-mode I/II loading were more likely to exhibit an interlaminar fracture path in the composite substrates than when loaded in either pure modes I or II. The propensity for a given joint to exhibit such a fracture path via delamination of the composite substrate has been explained by calculating the transverse tensile stresses induced in the loaded composite arms, and comparing this value to the measured transverse tensile strength of the composite. Following this approach, the underlying reasons for the observed fracture path were identified and could be predicted. Also, the proposed scheme provides a route to design against delamination failure occurring in adhesively-bonded fibre-composite test specimens. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Crack initiation and crack growth resistance in elastic plastic materials, dominated by crack-tip plasticity are analyzed with the crack modeled as a cohesive zone. Two different types (exponential and bilinear) of cohesive zone models (CZMs) have been used to represent the mechanical behavior of the cohesive zones. In this work, it is suggested that different forms of CZMs (e.g., exponential, bilinear) are the manifestations of different micromechanisms-based inelastic processes that participate in dissipating energy during the fracture process and each form is specific to each material system. It is postulated that the total energy release rate comprises the plastic dissipation rate in the bounding material and the separation energy rate within the fracture process zone, the latter is determined by CZMs. The total energy release rate then becomes a function of the material properties (e.g., yield strength, strain hardening exponent) and cohesive properties of the fracture process zone (e.g., cohesive strength and cohesive energy), and the form of cohesive zone model (CZM) that determines the rate of energy dissipation in the forward and wake regions of the crack. The effects of material parameters, cohesive zone parameters as well as the form/shape of CZMs in predicting the crack growth resistance and the size of plastic zone (SPZ) surrounding the crack tip are systematically examined. It is found that in addition to the cohesive strength and cohesive energy, the form (shape) of the traction–separation law of CZM plays a very critical role in determining the crack growth resistance (R-curve) of a given material. It is further observed that the shape of the CZM corresponds to inelastic processes active in the forward and wake regions of the crack, and has a profound influence on the R-curve and SPZ.},

abstract = {A cohesive-zone model for a fiber-reinforced polymer–matrix composite is presented. A two-parameter model with a characteristic toughness and a characteristic strength can be used to predict the fracture of notched or cracked specimens. The two parameters can be determined by comparing numerical predictions to experimental observations of a fracture test. It is shown that the engineering behavior, in terms of strength, deformation and energy dissipation is well-described by such a two-parameter model, but when the characteristic dimensions of the composite structure (e.g., the initial crack length or ligament length) are very small, extra details about the cohesive law such as the matrix-cracking strength may be required. Finally, it is shown that a cohesive-zone model provides excellent predictions of transitions between stable and catastrophic crack growth in the composite, and, hence, permits an understanding of the energy dissipation during fracture that occurs in these different regimes.},

abstract = {The significance of particle cavitation in rubber-toughened polymers remains controversial. While some researchers believe void formation promotes shear yielding in the polymer matrix, others consider it as a secondary energy consuming process. The research described here was undertaken to further elucidate the role of particle cavitation in toughening through comparative examination of epoxies modified by conventional rubber modifiers and hollow plastic particles. The results of this study illustrate that rubber particles with different cavitation resistance and pre-existing microvoids toughen the present epoxy matrix in the same manner. Therefore, we conclude that the cavitation resistance of the rubbery phase does not directly contribute to toughness, but instead simply allows the matrix to deform by shear. An additional mechanism of microcracking was observed when 40-mu m hollow plastic particles were employed. Despite the similar behaviour in fracture toughness testing, rubber particles and microvoids differ considerably in how they affect the compressive yield strength of the blend. The results of this study suggest the possible importance of inter-particle distance in toughening of epoxies. This concept will be examined in part 2 of this study.

abstract = {Two types of conventional rubber modifiers and a series of hollow plastic micro-spheres were employed as toughening agents in a diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA) epoxy in Part I (Bagheri R, Pearson RA. Polymer 1996;37:4529) of this study. It was found that the rubber modifiers with different cavitation resistance and hollow plastic micro-spheres which act as pre-existing microvoids toughen epoxies in the same manner. The current study is composed to further examine the previous results in terms of the role inter-particle distance in rubber/microvoid toughened epoxies. It is shown that the fracture toughness in toughened blends goes through a ductile-to-brittle transition with inter-particle distance. The source of this transition is found to be a stress state change provided by voided particles. The Ligament between neighboring particles, thus, experiences a transition from plane strain to plane stress state by decreasing the inter-particle distance. Interestingly, it is shown that the transition in toughened blends does not occur at a specific inter-particle distance as frequently proposed in literature, but varies with the size of the modifier. Therefore, there is an influence of particle size on yielding of the toughened epoxies that is responsible for the shift in transition. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Dynamic crack growth is analysed numerically for a plane strain block with an initial central crack subject to tensile loading. The continuum is characterized by a material constitutive law that relates stress and strain, and by a relation between the tractions and displacement jumps across a specified set of cohesive surfaces. The material constitutive relation is that of an isotropic hyperelastic solid. The cohesive surface constitutive relation allows for the creation of new free surface and dimensional considerations introduce a characteristic length into the formulation. Full transient analyses are carried out. Crack branching emerges as a natural outcome of the initial-boundary value problem solution, without any ad hoc assumption regarding branching criteria. Coarse mesh calculations are used to explore various qualitative features such as the effect of impact velocity on crack branching, and the effect of an inhomogeneity in strength, as in crack growth along or up to an interface. The effect of cohesive surface orientation on crack path is also explored, and for a range of orientations zigzag crack growth precedes crack branching. Finer mesh calculations are carried out where crack growth is confined to the initial crack plane. The crack accelerates and then grows at a constant speed that, for high impact velocities, can exceed the Rayleigh wave speed. This is due to the finite strength of the cohesive surfaces. A fine mesh calculation is also carried out where the path of crack growth is not constrained. The crack speed reaches about 45{\%} of the Rayleigh wave speed, then the crack speed begins to oscillate and crack branching at an angle of about 29° from the initial crack plane occurs. The numerical results are at least qualitatively in accord with a wide variety of experimental observations on fast crack growth in brittle solids.},

abstract = {Rate effects in the failure behavior are investigated for adhesive bonds in which the source of time- dependence is the rate of the material separation in the fracture process zone. A rate-dependent cohesive zone model (CZM) is described and used to analyze rate effects during debonding. The model consists of a rate-independent CZM in parallel to a Maxwell element. General implications derived for the model with respect to rate effects in the failure behavior of adhesives are presented. The application of the model to the analysis of crack growth is described in a companion paper. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper deals with the analysis of size effect in concrete. An extensive campaign of accurate numerical simulations, based on the cohesive crack model, is performed to compute the size effect curves (CSEC) for typical test configurations. The results are analyzed with reference to the classical Ba{\v{z}}ant's size effect law (SEL) to investigate the relationship between CSEC and SEL. This analysis shows that as specimen size tends to infinity, the SEL represents the asymptote of the CSEC, and that the SEL parameter known as the effective fracture process zone length is a material property which can be expressed as a function of the cohesive crack law (CCL) parameters. Finally, the practical implications of this study are discussed in relation to the use of the CSEC or the SEL for the identification of the CCL parameters through the size effect method.},

abstract = {Hybrid materials have been formed using an epoxy polymeric matrix and a range of inorganic particles, including mica and organically-modified montmorillonites ('organoclays'), with various concentrations of the silicate modifier up to about 30 wt.{\%} depending upon the viscosity increase induced by the presence of the silicate. Wide-angle and small-angle X-ray scattering plus transmission electron microscopy were used to identify the morphologies produced, which included particulate, intercalated and ordered exfoliated. The modulus of these composites increased with the weight fraction of silicate. The morphology had a small effect on the measured modulus; the nano-composites with the ordered exfoliated microstructure showing the highest values of the modulus for a given volume fraction of silicate. The fracture toughness, K-c, and the fracture energy, G(c), initially increased as the weight fraction of the silicate was increased, but then decreased at relatively high concentrations. The measured moduli and toughnesses were compared to theoretical predictions. The measured moduli values showed very good agreement with the predicted values, whilst the agreement for values of the measured fracture energy, G(c), with the predicted values, based upon a crack deflection toughening mechanism, were less convincing. Indeed, analysis of the fracture surfaces using scanning electron microscopy showed that the main toughening effect of the silicate particles is due to plastic deformation of the epoxy matrix around the particles.

@article{Broutman197198,
abstract = {The fracture toughness of glass sphere filled epoxy and polyester resins was studied as a function of interfacial strength and volume fraction of glass. The toughness was determined using a tapered cleavage specime. The interface strength was varied by surface treatments applied to the glass spheres. A mold release treatment (Dow Corning DC-20) was used to represent the extreme condition of zero interfacial strength and silane coupling agents were used to achieve various degrees of interfacial strength. It was found that the fracture toughness, for all surface treatments, increased with the addition of glass spheres to the resin and went through a maximum between 20 to 30 volume percent. Furthermore, the toughness was a maximum for those surface treatments producing poor adhesion between glass and resin. Unnotched Izod impact strengths do not correlate with the above results but do correlate with areas under stress-strain curves. Theories are presented to explain these results based on microscopic investigation of fracture surfaces and assumed fracture mechanisms. },

abstract = {An epoxy resin, cured with an anhydride, has been modified by the addition of silica nanoparticles. The particles were introduced via a sole gel technique which gave a very well-dispersed phase of nanosilica particles of about 20 nm in diameter. AFM and TEM showed that the nanoparticles were well-dispersed in the epoxy matrix. T. was unchanged by the addition of the nanoparticles, but both the modulus and toughness increased. The fracture energy increased from 100J/m for the unmodified epoxy to 460J/m for the epoxy with 13 vol{\%} of nanosilica. The fracture surfaces were inspected using SEM and AFM, and the results were compared to various toughening mechanisms proposed in the literature. The microscopy showed evidence of debonding of the nanoparticles and subsequent plastic void growth. A theoretical model of plastic void growth was used to confirm that this mechanism was indeed most likely to be responsible for the increased toughness that was observed due to the presence of the nanoparticles.},

abstract = {Adhesive joints have been widely used in the automotive and aerospace fields in order to reduce the weights of products. The strength of adhesive joints, accordingly, needs to be increased and their behaviour should be predicted in order to achieve accurate designs. Studies to improve the strength of adhesive joints via surface treatment methods or by using two adhesives with different mechanical properties have been conducted. Various modeling methods also have been studied to predict the behaviour of adhesive joints. Unfortunately, the relationship between the bonding surface roughness and adhesive joint strength needs to be further clarified in order to be applied in practical design. As analyzing the relationship through a conventional finite element method assuming perfect bonding is challenging, the behaviour of the adhesive joints may be analyzed using a cohesive zone model or interface modeling methods from an integrating released energy point of view. The strength of adhesive joints can be improved via micro-patterning due to the mechanical interlocking effect. Therefore, in this study, a micro-pattern was fabricated to improve the strength of adhesive joints. Various pattern-sized single leg bending joints and end notched flexure joints were manufactured and experimented upon. In this study, characteristics of each pattern surface were independently classified and modeled with a cohesive zone model. Finite element analyses were then performed and simulation results were compared with experimental results. The numerical results satisfactorily describe the experimental results, and failure loads were predicted with a maximum relative error of 8{\%}. From these results, it may be concluded that the present findings can be applied to practical design and that the failure load can be predicted via a finite element analysis.},

abstract = {The dynamics of multiwall carbon nanotube (MWCNT) alignment inside viscous media using electric fields is investigated. Electrical current measurements were performed in situ during the application of an electric field to liquid solutions of deionized water or dissolved polymer containing MWCNTs. The variation of electrical current over time was associated to the dynamics of the MWCNT network formation. The influence of the electric field magnitude and frequency on the MWCNT network formation was studied. MWCNT migration towards the negative electrode was observed when a direct current electric field was applied, whereas formation of an aligned MWCNT network was achieved for an alternating current electric field. The increase of the electric field frequency promotes a faster formation of an aligned MWCNT network and thinner MWCNT bundles. A higher viscosity of the liquid medium yields slower MWCNT alignment evidenced by a slower change of electrical current through the viscous system. An analytical model based on the dielectrophoresis-induced torque, which considers the viscosity of the medium, is also proposed to explain the dynamics of MWCNT alignment. Furthermore, aligned MWCNT/polysulfone solid composites were fabricated and electrically characterized. The solid composites presented anisotropic electrical conductivity, which was more evident for low MWCNT concentrations (0.1-0.2 wt{\%}).},

abstract = {While the geometry of aerospace assemblies is carefully controlled, for many industrial applications such as marine structures bond line thickness can vary significantly. In this study epoxy adhesive joints of different thicknesses between aluminium substrates have been characterized using physico-chemical analyses (differential scanning calorimetry, DSC; dynamic mechanical analysis, DMA; spectroscopy), nano-indentation and mechanical testing. Thermal analyses indicated no influence of thickness on structure. Nano-indentation revealed no evidence of an interphase at the metal/epoxy interface, nor any change in modulus for different thicknesses, though Raman spectroscopy suggested there may be slight variations in composition close to the substrates. However, mechanical testing using the modified Arcan fixture indicated a significant drop in strength and failure strain under pure tension and a smaller reduction for tension/shear and pure shear loads as thickness increased. Examination of sections through joints did not indicate any physical reason for this, but numerical analysis of the stress state revealed larger stress concentration factors for tensile loading in thick joints, which may explain the thickness effect. It is recommended that joint thickness should be kept below 0.8 mm to avoid obtaining artificially low values with the Arcan test. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The former and latter treatments demonstrated well- and poorly-bonded interfaces between the particle and matrix, respectively. The experimental results showed that the fracture toughness of DCB specimens increases with particle size and with interfacial strength of silica/matrix depending on the particle content.

abstract = {The addition of silica nanoparticles (23 nm, 74 nm, and 170 nm) to a lightly crosslinked, model epoxy resin, was studied. The effect of silica nanoparticle content and particle size on glass transition temperature (T-g), coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), Young's modulus (E), yield stress (sigma), fracture energy (G(IC)) and fracture toughness (K-IC), were investigated. The toughening mechanisms were determined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and transmission optical microscopy (TOM). The experimental results revealed that the addition of silica nanoparticles did not have a significant effect on T-g or the yield stress of epoxy resin, i.e. the yield stress and T-g remained constant regardless of silica nanoparticle size. As expected, the addition of silica nanoparticles had a significant impact on CTE, modulus and fracture toughness. The CTE values of nanosilica-filled epoxies were found to decrease with increasing silica nanoparticle content, which can be attributed to the much lower CTE of the silica nanoparticles. Interestingly, the decreases in CTE showed strong particle size dependence. The Young's modulus was also found to significantly improve with addition of silica nanoparticles and increase with increasing filler content. However, the particle size did not exhibit any effect on the Young's modulus. Finally, the fracture toughness and fracture energy showed significant improvements with the addition of silica nanoparticles, and increased with increasing filler content. The effect of particle size on fracture toughness was negligible. Observation of the fracture surfaces using SEM and TOM showed evidence of debonding of silica nanoparticles, matrix void growth, and matrix shear banding, which are credited for the increases in toughness for nanosilica-filled epoxy systems. Shear banding mechanism was the dominant mechanism while the particle debonding and plastic void growth were the minor mechanisms. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The durability of adhesively bonded aluminium-alloy joints have been investigated by undertaking cyclic-fatigue tests in liquid water and in 55{\%} RH, to establish the threshold adhesive fracture energy, Gth, below which crack growth will not occur. Three surface pretreatments were employed: grit-blast and degreasing (GBD), phosphoric-acid anodising (PAA), and PAA followed by the application of an anti-corrosion primer (PAAP). The ranking of the durability for the six systems, as assessed by the value of Gth, is as follows: X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and energy-filtered transmission-electron microscopy have been used to assess the nature of the locus of failure and the mechanisms of failure. For the GBD pretreated joints, tested in both the liquid water and in 55{\%} RH environments, failure occurs predominantly by the thermodynamic displacement of the adhesive from the metal substrate, according to the well-established principles of interfacial thermodynamics. In the case of the PAA and PAAP surface pretreatments, the anodising process provides additional adhesion forces and stability to the interface, which involves the formation of a microcomposite interphase region, and failure is shown to occur in a cohesive manner entirely within the adhesive for the tests undertaken in the 55{\%} RH environment. For the specimens tested in liquid water, in the threshold region, the joints show loci of failure which are predominantly within the adhesive but with small areas of interfacial failure and oxide failure. The differences in durability for the PAAP and PAA when exposed to 55{\%} RH or liquid water is ascribed to the kinetics of aggregation of water in the environs of the metal/adhesive interface, this phenomenon occurring much more rapidly for exposure to liquid water during the cyclic-fatigue process than for the exposure to water vapour at 55{\%} RH. A method based on the XPS analysis of failure surfaces has been used to assess the extent of interfacial failure of the joint prepared from anodised stock. This is shown to be up to 95{\%} depending on treatment and exposure conditions.},

abstract = {The phenomena of crack initiation, propagation and ultimate fracture are studied here under the following assumptions: (i) the crack law is modelled by means of a cohesive zone model and (ii) the crack paths are postulated a priori. In this context, a variational formulation is proposed which relies on an augmented Lagrangian. A mixed interface finite element is introduced to discretise the crack paths, the degrees of freedom of which consist in the displacement on both crack lips and the density of cohesive forces. This enables an exact treatment of multi-valued cohesive laws (e.g. initial adhesion, contact conditions, possible rigid unloading, etc.), without penalty regularisation. A special attention is paid to the convergence with mesh-refinement, i.e. the well-posedness of the problem, on the basis of theoretical results of contact mechanics and some complementary numerical investigations. Fulfilment of the LBB condition is the key factor to gain the desired properties. Moreover, it is shown that the integration of the constitutive law admits a unique solution as soon as some condition on the augmented Lagrangian is enforced. Finally, a 3D simulation shows the applicability to practical engineer problems, including in particular the robustness of the formulation and its compatibility with classical solution algorithms (Newton method, line-search, path-following techniques).},

As the filler dimension became smaller, the dispersion parameter Do., largely decreased as quantified, which demonstrated the challenges associated with improving the dispersion of smaller fillers.

abstract = {An epoxy resin, cured using an anhydride hardener, has been modified by the addition of pre-formed polysiloxane core-shell rubber (S-CSR) particles with a mean diameter of 0.18 $\mu$m. The glass transition temperature, Tg, of the cured unmodified epoxy polymer was 148 °C, and this was unchanged after the addition of the S-CSR particles. The polysiloxane rubber particles had a Tg of about −100 °C. Atomic force microscopy showed that the S-CSR particles were well-dispersed in the epoxy polymer. The addition of the S-CSR particles reduced the Young's modulus and tensile strength of the epoxy polymer, but at 20 °C the fracture energy, GIc, increased from 117 J/m2 for the unmodified epoxy to 947 J/m2 when 20 wt{\%} of the S-CSR particles were incorporated. Fracture tests were also performed at −55 °C, −80 °C, and −109 °C. The results showed that the measured fracture energy of the S-CSR-modified epoxy polymers decreased significantly below room temperature. For example, at −109 °C, a fracture energy of 481 J/m2 was measured using 20 wt{\%} of S-CSR particles. Nevertheless, this value of toughness still represented a major increase compared with the unmodified epoxy polymer, which possessed a value of GIc of 174 J/m2 at this very low test temperature. Thus, a clear fact that emerged was that the addition to the epoxy polymer of the S-CSR particles may indeed lead to significant toughening of the epoxy, even at temperatures as low as about −100 °C. The toughening mechanisms induced by the S-CSR particles were identified as (a) localised plastic shear-band yielding around the particles and (b) cavitation of the particles followed by plastic void growth of the epoxy polymer. These mechanisms were modelled using the Hsieh et al. approach [33,49] and the values of GIc of the S-CSR-modified epoxy polymers at the different test temperatures were calculated. Excellent agreement was found between the predictions and the experimentally measured fracture energies. Further, the experimental and modelling results of the present study indicated that the extent of plastic void growth was suppressed at low temperatures for the S-CSR-modified epoxy polymers, but that the localised shear-band yielding mechanism was relatively insensitive to the test temperature.},

abstract = {A fracture mechanics approach has been used to investigate how the addition of high-temperature resistant thermoplastic modifiers can increase the fracture energy, Gc, of brittle cyanate-ester polymers. Tests were performed using adhesive joint specimens at −55, 21 and 150°C. The fracture energies of poly(ether sulfone)- and polyester-modified cyanate-ester polymers have been measured and scanning electron microscopy has been used to identify the toughening mechanisms involved. Firstly, it is shown that the addition of 25{\%} by weight of a functionalised poly(ether sulfone) (PES) can increase the fracture energy of the cyanate-ester polymers by more than 800{\%}, with the development of a particulate morphology within the modified polymer. Secondly, it is demonstrated that the use of 20{\%} by weight of a polyester-copolymer elastomer can lead to an increase in the fracture energy of up to ten times that of the unmodified cyanate-ester polymer value. Thirdly, it is shown that several of the chemically-modified polymers developed and tested in the present work have fracture energies which are greater than a typical commercially-available cyanate-ester film adhesive. Finally, the effects of long-term ageing in air at 150°C, for up to 7500 hours, on the properties of unmodified, physically- and chemically-modified cyanate-ester polymers are investigated. It is shown that the measured fracture energies of some of these modified cyanate-ester polymers show no significant effect of such long-term ageing.},

abstract = {A Lagrangian finite element method of fracture and fragmentation in brittle materials is developed. A cohesive-law fracture model is used to propagate multiple cracks along arbitrary paths. In axisymmetric calculations, radial cracking is accounted for through a continuum damage model. An explicit contact/friction algorithm is used to treat the multi-body dynamics which inevitably ensues after fragmentation. Rate-dependent plasticity, heat conduction and thermal coupling are also accounted for in calculations. The properties and predictive ability of the model are exhibited in two case studies: spall tests and dynamic crack propagation in a double cantilever beam specimen. As an example of application of the theory, we simulate the experiments of Field (1988) involving the impact of alumina plates by steel pellets at different velocities. The calculated conical, lateral and radial fracture histories are found to be in good agreement with experiment.},

@article{Sun2008,
abstract = {To enable the effective and reliable use of structural adhesive bonding in automotive applications, the cohesive properties of a joint need to be determined over a wide range of loading rates. In this paper, a strategy for determining these properties has been described and used to analyze a set of experimental results presented in a companion paper. In the particular system studied, a crack growing in a toughened quasi-static mode could make a catastrophic transition to a brittle mode of fracture. The cohesive parameters for both the toughened and brittle modes of crack growth were determined by comparing numerical predictions from cohesive-zone simulations to the results of experimental tests performed using double-cantilever beam specimens and tensile tests. The cohesive parameters were found to be essentially rate-independent for the toughened mode, but the toughness dropped by a factor of four upon a transition to the brittle mode. The results of wedge tests were used as an independent verification of the cohesive parameters, and to verify that the quasi-static properties remained rate-independent to very high crack velocities corresponding to conditions of low-velocity impact. The effects of friction, and the use of the wedge test to determine cohesive parameters, were also explored. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Cooper2012,
abstract = {The current work is a combined experimental-numerical study of the fracture behaviour of a nano-toughened, structural epoxy adhesive. The mode I fracture toughness of the adhesive is measured using tapered double-cantilever beam (TDCB) tests with various bond gap thicknesses ranging from 0.25 mm to 2.5 mm. Circumferentially deep-notched tensile specimens are independently employed to measure the cohesive strength of the adhesive as a function of constraint. The experimental TDCB test results are predicted numerically for each bond gap thickness using the Finite Volume method and a Dugdale cohesive zone model. A unique relationship between the fracture energy and the constraint level is established. The effect of bond gap thickness on the fracture behaviour of TDCB joints is hence directly attributed to the variation of the intrinsic fracture energy with constraint and not to the variation of the ‘far field' plastic zone size with bond gap thickness. Using the well known Rice and Tracey void growth model, a link is established between the voids observed in the fracture process zone, the constraint imposed by the thickness of the adhesive and the resulting fracture energy.},

abstract = {We investigate the use of cohesive theories of fracture, in conjunction with the explicit resolution of the near-tip plastic fields and the enforcement of closure as a contact constraint, for the purpose of fatigue-life prediction. An important characteristic of the cohesive laws considered here is that they exhibit unloading-reloading hysteresis. This feature has the important consequence of preventing shakedown and allowing for steady crack growth. Our calculations demonstrate that the theory is capable of a unified treatment of long cracks under constant-amplitude loading, short cracks and the effect of overloads, without ad hoc corrections or tuning.},

abstract = {The present paper investigates the effect of adding silica nanoparticles to an anhydride-cured epoxy polymer in bulk and when used as the matrix of carbon- and glass-fibre reinforced composites. The formation of 'hybrid' epoxy polymers, containing both silica nanoparticles and carboxyl-terminated butadiene-acrylonitrile (CTBN) rubber microparticles, is also discussed. The structure/property relationships are considered, with an emphasis on the toughness and the toughening mechanisms. The fracture energy of the bulk epoxy polymer was increased from 77 to 212 J/m(2) by the presence of 20 wt{\%} of silica nanoparticles. The observed toughening mechanisms that were operative were (a) plastic shear-yield bands, and (b) debonding of the matrix from the silica nanoparticles, followed by plastic void-growth of the epoxy. The largest increases in toughness observed were for the 'hybrid' materials. Here a maximum fracture energy of 965 J/m(2) was measured for a 'hybrid' epoxy polymer containing 9 wt{\%} and 15 wt{\%} of the rubber microparticles and silica nanoparticles, respectively. Most noteworthy was the observation that these increases in the toughness of the bulk polymers were found to be transferred to the fibre composites. Indeed, the interlaminar fracture energies for the fibre-composite materials were increased even further by a fibre-bridging toughening mechanism. The present work also extends an existing model to predict the toughening effect of the nanoparticles in a thermoset polymer. There was excellent agreement between the predictions and the experimental data for the epoxy containing the silica nanoparticles, and for epoxy polymers containing micrometre-sized glass particles. The latter, relatively large, glass particles were investigated to establish whether a 'nano-effect', with respect to increasing the toughness of the epoxy bulk polymers, did indeed exist.},

abstract = {The geometrical factors defining an adhesive joint are of great importance as its design greatly conditions the performance of the bonding One of the most relevant geometrical factors is the thickness of the adhesive as it decisively influences the mechanical properties of the bonding and has a clear economic impact on the manufacturing processes or long runs The traditional mechanical joints (riveting, welding, etc) are characterised by a predictable performance, and are very reliable in service conditions Thus, Structural adhesive joints will only be selected in industrial applications demanding mechanical requirements and adverse environmental conditions if the Suitable reliability (the same or higher than the mechanical joints) is guaranteed. For this purpose, the objective of this paper is to analyse the Influence of the adhesive thickness on the mechanical behaviour of the joint and, by means of a statistical analysis based oil Weibull distribution, propose the optimum thickness for the adhesive combining the best mechanical performance and high reliability. This procedure, which is applicable Without a great deal of difficulty to other joints and adhesives, provides a general use for a more reliable use of adhesive bondings and, therefore, for a better and wider use in the industrial manufacturing processes (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved},

@article{Cognard2011,
abstract = {The use of adhesively bonded joints is often limited by a lack of reliable models able to accurately predict their behaviour in industrial applications, in which the stress distribution is often complex. The mechanical behaviour of an adhesive in a bonded joint is often heavily dependent on its stress state (i.e., the tensile{\&}{\#}8211;shear combinations). Thus, a large experimental database is required to accurately represent the complex behaviour of an adhesive in a bonded joint. On the one hand, the initial yield surface (initial elastic limit) often has to be described taking into account the two stress invariants, hydrostatic stress and von Mises equivalent stress, and on the other hand the non-linear behaviour of the adhesive is also quite complex to model. However, the mechanical response of adhesively bonded joints often presents quite large stress concentrations; thus, the analysis of experimental tests is made particularly difficult. Obtaining reliable experimental results makes it possible to contribute to optimization of an adhesive in a bonded joint. This paper presents comparisons between results of different experimental tests (with bulk and bonded joints), some of them are designed to greatly limit the edge effects. Results are presented for two adhesives under proportional monotonic loadings. The two adhesives have very different behaviours (a ductile adhesive and a brittle adhesive) and two different surface preparations of aluminium substrates (a mechanical preparation and a chemical preparation recommended by the adhesive manufacturer) were studied.},

abstract = {The materials science community has identified nanoparticle dispersion as a primary challenge area for the advancement of polymer nanocomposites technology. Although nanoparticle dispersion can significantly impact important engineering properties, it is not itself a quantifiable property: qualitative TEM image assessments remain as the 'gold standard' for dispersion characterization. While numerous quantitative dispersion analyses have been proposed, they have often proven Cumbersome, system specific and unreflective of the proposed benefits of nanoparticle reinforcement. No single quantitative method has been adopted by the community to date and inferences about processing and dispersion effects generally require subjective analysis. This paper presents a quantitative dispersion characterization method which 1) makes use of standard TEM dispersion images; 2) directly reflects proposed nanoscale reinforcement mechanisms: 3) outputs a single performance metric. By quantitatively isolating dispersion effects, this technique may help to link disparate studies in the literature while providing defensible quantitative insights into nanoscale reinforcement mechanisms.

abstract = {The dynamics of multiwall carbon nanotube (MWCNT) alignment inside viscous media using electric fields is investigated. Electrical current measurements were performed in situ during the application of an electric field to liquid solutions of deionized water or dissolved polymer containing MWCNTs. The variation of electrical current over time was associated to the dynamics of the MWCNT network formation. The influence of the electric field magnitude and frequency on the MWCNT network formation was studied. MWCNT migration towards the negative electrode was observed when a direct current electric field was applied, whereas formation of an aligned MWCNT network was achieved for an alternating current electric field. The increase of the electric field frequency promotes a faster formation of an aligned MWCNT network and thinner MWCNT bundles. A higher viscosity of the liquid medium yields slower MWCNT alignment evidenced by a slower change of electrical current through the viscous system. An analytical model based on the dielectrophoresis-induced torque, which considers the viscosity of the medium, is also proposed to explain the dynamics of MWCNT alignment. Furthermore, aligned MWCNT/polysulfone solid composites were fabricated and electrically characterized. The solid composites presented anisotropic electrical conductivity, which was more evident for low MWCNT concentrations (0.1-0.2 wt{\%}).},

abstract = {The competition between craze formation and shear band formation at small glass beads embedded in matrices of glassy polymers has been investigated. This has been done by performing constant strain rate tensile tests over a wide range of strain rates and temperatures, and examining the deformation pattern formed at the beads with a light microscope. The glassy polymers under investigation were polystyrene, polycarbonate, and two types of styrene—acrylonitrile copolymer. It was found that besides matrix properties, strain rate and temperature, the degree of interfacial adhesion between the glass beads and the matrix also has a profound effect on the competition between craze and shear band formation: at excellently adhering beads craze formation is favoured, whereas at poorly adhering beads shear band formation is favoured. This effect is caused by the difference in local stress situation, craze formation being favoured under a triaxial stress state and shear band formation under a biaxial stress state. The kinetics of crazing and shear deformation have also been studied, using a simple model and Eyring's rate theory of plastic deformation. The results suggest that chain scission may be the rate-determining step in crazing but not in shear deformation.},

abstract = {The present work considers the numerical simulation of the steady-state fracture of adhesively bonded joints in various peel test configurations. The model is based on a multiscale approach involving the simulation of the continuum elastoplastic response of the adherends and the adhesive layer, as well as of the fracture process taking place inside the adhesive layer using a cohesive zone formulation. The model parameters are firstly identified by comparison with experimental results obtained with the wedge-peel test. Secondly, the ability of the model to predict peel test results obtained with different peel test configurations (e.g. wedge-peel or fixed-arm peel test geometries and various adhesive layer or arm thicknesses) is critically assessed by comparison with experimental data. Thirdly, the results of the steady-state simulations are post-processed in order to: (i) evaluate the adhesive fracture energy, (ii) quantify and discuss the different contributions to plastic dissipation within the adhesive layer, and (iii) explain how these mechanisms affect the adhesive fracture energy as a function of the peel test configuration. The values of adhesive fracture energy, Ga, deduced from the numerical simulations proposed in the present paper, from all the various elastic–plastic peel test configurations, lie in the range of about 900±50 J/m2; whilst the values from a previous analytical model and a node-release finite-element analysis model, for a cohesive fracture of the present adhesive, all lie in the range of about 1100±250 J/m2. Thus, there is very good agreement between the different modelling methods. These values are clearly also in good agreement with the corresponding value from the well-established LEFM TDCB method of 1140±170 J/m2.},

abstract = {Crack growth initiation and subsequent resistance is computed for an elastic-plastic solid with an idealized traction -separation law specified on the crack plane to characterize the fracture process. The solid is specified by its Young's modulus,E, Poisson's ratio, v, initial tensile yield stress, $\sigma$Y,and strain hardening exponent,N. The primary parameters specifying the traction—separation law of the fracture process are the work of separation per unit area, $\Gamma$0, and the peak traction, $\sigma${\&}{\#}x030C;gs. Highly refined calculations have been carried out for resistance curves, KR($\Delta$a), for plane strain, mode I growth in small-scale yielding as dependent on the parameters characterizing the elastic-plastic properties of the solid and its fracture process. With K0= [E$\gamma$0(1 − v2)]12 as the intensity needed to advance the crack in the absence of plasticity, KRK0 is presented in terms of its dependence on the two most important parameters, $\sigma$̌$\sigma$Y and N, with special emphasis on initiation toughness and steady-state toughness. Three applications of the results are made : to predict toughnesss when the fracture process is void growth and coalescence, to predict the role of plasticity on interface toughness for similar materials bonded together, and to illuminate the role of plasticity in enhancing toughness in dual-phase solids. The regime of applicability of the present model to ductile fracture due to void growth and coalescence, wherein multiple voids interact within the fracture process zone, is complementary to the regime of applicability of models describing the interaction between a single void and the crack tip. The two mechanism regimes are delineated and the consequence of a transition between them is discussed.},

@article{DaSilva2009,
abstract = {An extensive literature review on existing analytical models for both single and double-lap joints has been made to assist the designer to choose the right model for a particular application. The literature review shows that almost all analytical models for adhesively bonded lap joints are two-dimensional. This is generally sufficient because the stresses in the width direction are significantly lower than in the direction of the loading. Most of the analyses are linear elastic for both adherends and adhesive because the inclusion of material non-linearity renders the solution too complex. As the degree of complexity and the number of stress components in the adhesive and the adherends increase, the initial analytical problem must be solved numerically. A summary of the main analyses is presented indicating the conditions of applicability and the stress components considered. A comparative study of various models of increasing complexity and how strength predictions based on these models compare with experimental data is presented in an accompanying paper.
